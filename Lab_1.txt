We will create our first VHDL design, and then simulate the design to make sure it is correct.

The design will have three inputs :

1) current_temp , a 7 bit vector, as an input

2) desired_temp, a 7 bit vector, as an input

3) display_select, a signle bit

The design will have one output, temp_display.

The logic we want is that if the display_select is a '1' we want to put current_temp out on temp_display, 
but if the display_select is a '0', we want to put desired_temp on the output temp_display.


You should create an entity and architecture for this lab.   You should then simulate in either Modelsim or Vivado.

Questions for this assignment
What will be the basic structure of you design, and how will you get the VHDL design to accomplish the objectives?

--New design.

1) Add 2 new outputs to our entity ,  A_C_ON , and FURNACE_ON.

2) Add logic for determining when the A_C_ON and FURNACE_ON are '1', and when they are '0'.

3) Create a testbench to verify design operates logically correct.

4) Verify in the testbench the display_out , the a_c_on, and furnace_on.

5) The testbench should sequentially test the correct operation of each output.

Questions for this assignment
How will lab 2 be implemented to add the functionality of controlling the A_C_ON and the FURNACE_ON outputs with the added input COOL and HEAT?



-- Code 

entity thermo is 
port (current_temp : in bit_vector(6 downto 0); 
      desired_temp : in bit_vector(6 downto 0); 
      display_sel  : in bit; 
      COOL         : in bit;

      Furnace_ON   : out bit; 
      display_temp : out bit_vector(6 downto 0)); 

end thermo; 

architecture test of thermo is 
begin 

process(current_temp,desired_temp,display_sel,COOL,HEAT)
begin 

if display_sel = '1' then 
display_temp <= current_temp; 
else 
display_temp <= desired_temp;
-- Other Bits added to it
if (current_temp > desired_temp) then
COOL = '1';
AC_ON <= COOL; 
elsif (current_temp < desired_temp) then 
HEAT = '1';
Furnace_ON <= HEAT; 
else 
COOL = '0';
HEAT = '0';
AC_ON <= COOL; 
Furnace_ON <= HEAT;
